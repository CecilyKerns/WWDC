 # Lively Labels üè∑
 Now we have our button visible, but it can't do anything yet. We can't start a tap battle or see how many taps we got in general. Let's change that!
 
 What we need is something called a [label](glossary://Label)! In this game, I used labels to display the time left during the current tap battle and to display how many taps the user got overall.
 
 We'll need to call a new function in order to bring the labels back! In this case, it's a function called ```showLabels()```. Try it out, but be careful, this time you don't have a placeholder hinting at you what to type. Good luck!*/
