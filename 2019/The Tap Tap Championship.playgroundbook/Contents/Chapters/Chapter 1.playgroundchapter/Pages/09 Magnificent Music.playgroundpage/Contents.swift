 And now... The last piece of the puzzle: Music. The element of music is crucial in setting the mood and making sure a user's experience with our program is a good one.
 
 With music in mind, let's go back to the idea of variables expressed in "Beautiful Backgrounds," where you can customize the music for this portion to your liking through editing the variable: ```backgroundMusic```'s value.
 
 Go on and change ```backgroundMusic```'s value to ```.lobby```, ```.balcony```, or ```.boss.```*/
