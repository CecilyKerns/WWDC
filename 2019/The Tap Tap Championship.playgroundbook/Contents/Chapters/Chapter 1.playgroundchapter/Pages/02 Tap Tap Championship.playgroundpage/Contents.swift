 # Tap Tap Championship 🎮
 Hello! Today I'd like to teach you about coding a small game in Swift. Don't worry, Swift is easy! I just learned it a month ago and you can too!
 
 First of all, let's play the game you'll be making: Tap Tap Championship. Go ahead and play through it, and when you're ready to move on press "Run my code".
 
 *All artwork and music within my playground and game was created by me!

 💡 **Tip:** The goal of the game is to tap the button as fast as you can to beat your opponents, it's crazy fun!
 
 🔊 **Sound:** Make sure your alert sounds are on!
 
 ♿️ **VoiceOver:** This playground supports VoiceOver!
