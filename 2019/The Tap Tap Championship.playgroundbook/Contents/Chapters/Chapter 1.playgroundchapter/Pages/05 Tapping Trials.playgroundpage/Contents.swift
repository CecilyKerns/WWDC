 # Tapping Trials ðŸ”˜
We've come pretty far in terms of the look and heart of our game, but it still has no functionality. Let's re-introduce our button! To make our button appear, we'll need to call another function.
 
 For this, we'll use a function called ```showButton()```. This will make our button reappear on the screen.
 
 Go on and try to summon the button!
 
 ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Skip the dialogue before calling the function so you can see the button pop up before your eyes!
